# CartPusher

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

A lot of the work was done without version control, so that's why there's one very big commit in the beginning.

The bulk of the code controlling the cart mechanics can be found in its Actor Component at "CartPusher/Source/CartPusher/SphereCartActor.cpp".
